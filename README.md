# National Professional Soccer League (NPSL)
# The basis of the project was to create a web application with a functioning database using the Linux-Apache-MySQL-Python software stack. 
# I developed the project based on a topic of personal interest, the semi-pro soccer league I played in the summer before taking this course.
# This was a semester project at Boston University in Intro to Computer Science my first semester junior year.
